# Google Ads Bridge Campaign Plan

Date: May 16, 2026
Status: Ready for manual Google Ads setup; live creation is blocked by Adspirer quota until May 31, 2026.

## Goal

Create a separate Search campaign that sends traffic to the Duet bridge page, records one valid website conversion from the App Store CTA, and qualifies the Google Ads $300 credit without disturbing the current App Store-direct campaign.

## Campaign

- Customer ID: `6624784803`
- Campaign name: `DUET_SEARCH_BRIDGE_CTA_2026_05`
- Campaign type: Search
- Network: Google Search only
- Location: United States
- Language: English
- Status at creation: Paused
- Daily budget: `$10`
- Bidding: Maximize clicks with a tight CPC cap if available, or Manual CPC if Google Ads requires manual setup
- Final URL: `https://kohlivarun5.github.io/zoey-calendar-site/`

## Conversion Action

Create this before enabling the campaign:

- Source: Website
- Name: `Duet App Store CTA click`
- Category: Page view or Sign-up
- Value: Do not use a value
- Count: One
- Attribution: Data-driven if available
- Tag location: bridge site App Store CTA click

After Google Ads creates the conversion action, update `index.html`:

- `googleAdsId`: the global Google Ads tag ID, such as `AW-123456789`
- `conversionSendTo`: the full conversion destination, such as `AW-123456789/AbCdEfGhIj`

Do not enable the bridge campaign until the tag is installed and Google Tag Assistant can see the global tag.
